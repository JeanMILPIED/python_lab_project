yolo is training on our image dataset!!!!
drive with proper architecture is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1PnyCPg_nLcu4MeYnoKcY4-GvRz8LmjH_  
colab for yolo clothes is here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IxZwZ7se_eDMOEPGvfAJSCFwrR51ke55#scrollTo=vgl1MEE9LYgJ  
Next steps:  
- enrich the dataset of annotated images  
- more .csv clean files  
- comment everything  
- launch a night train on an AWS machine (collab is too slow = 59hours...)
